This folder is mostly for test scripts and demo display stuff. 
Mostly they're designed for a special use or to test a feature
you can probably get them to work on your system if you have a
poke around the code and change some paths, though none are
very interesting to be honest - though the background changer
one was really cool when i had it running on my pi3 powered
projector.   

It's probably best to ignore this folder to be honest.
